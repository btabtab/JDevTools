	"flipImage($axis)" - flips the image along it's x or y axis./
	"invertImage()" - turns all tiles into the opposite colour.
	"setBrushColour($colour)" - sets the plot function colour.
	"setCanvasColour($colour)" - sets the background colour.
	"cursorToggle()" - shows the cursor
	"moveCursor($x, $y)" - moves the cursor to the new pos.
	"shiftCursor($x, $y)" - moves the cursor by the specified amount.
	"insertText($text_to_insert)" - starts writing the text into the buffers pixels. only available if character rendering is enabled.
	"clearText($amount_to_clear_behind_cursor)" - moves the cursor back and erases data in this pixels.
	"save($file_name, $mode)" - saves the current buffer or output to a file on the disk.
	"load($file_name, $mode)" - loads a file from disk that will be put into the buffer.
	"exit()" - closes the application down.
